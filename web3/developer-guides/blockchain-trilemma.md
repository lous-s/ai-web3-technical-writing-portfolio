# The Blockchain Trilemma

## Overview
The blockchain trilemma describes the challenge of achieving decentralization, security, and scalability at the same time in a blockchain network.

## The Three Trade-offs
- **Decentralization:** No single authority controls the network.
- **Security:** The network resists attacks and failures.
- **Scalability:** The network can handle many transactions quickly.

## Why the Trilemma Exists
Improving one part of the system often weakens another due to limits in distributed systems.

## Real-World Examples
Bitcoin prioritizes security and decentralization but sacrifices speed.
Some newer blockchains improve speed but reduce decentralization.

## Implications for Protocol Design
Developers must choose trade-offs based on their use case.

## Summary
The trilemma explains why no blockchain is perfect at everything.
