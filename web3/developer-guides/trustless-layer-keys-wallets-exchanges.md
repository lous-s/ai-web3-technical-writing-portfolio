# The Trustless Layer: Keys, Wallets, and Exchanges

## Overview
Web3 systems are described as trustless because users do not rely on centralized intermediaries to control assets or approve transactions.

## Public and Private Keys
A private key proves ownership of funds.
A public key is derived from the private key and is used to receive assets.

## Wallets
Wallets store private keys and sign transactions on behalf of users.

## Wallets vs Exchanges
- **Non-custodial wallets:** Users control their private keys.
- **Custodial exchanges:** The platform controls the private keys.

## Security Considerations
Loss of private keys, phishing attacks, and malicious software are major risks.

## Summary
Trustless systems shift control and responsibility to the user.
