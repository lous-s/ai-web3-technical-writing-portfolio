# The Blockchain Trilemma (Explained Simply)

## Imagine This
Think of a phone that is very cheap, very fast, and very strong.
Usually, if you make it cheaper and faster, it becomes weaker.

Blockchains face a similar problem.

## The Three Things Blockchains Want
- **Decentralization:** No single person controls it.
- **Security:** It is hard to hack or break.
- **Scalability:** It works fast even when many people use it.

## Why All Three Are Hard Together
Making a blockchain faster often means fewer computers help run it.
Fewer computers can make it less secure or less decentralized.

## What This Means for You
Some blockchains are slower but safer.
Others are faster but rely on fewer trusted systems.

## Key Takeaway
Blockchains must choose trade-offs; no blockchain is perfect.
