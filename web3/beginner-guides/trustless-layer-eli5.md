# How Web3 Works Without Trust (Explained Simply)

## Think of It Like This
Imagine a house where only you have the key.
You don’t need to trust anyone else to enter your house.

## What “Trustless” Really Means
In Web3, trustless means you don’t need a middleman to approve your actions.
The system follows rules automatically.

## Wallets vs Exchanges
- A **wallet** is like holding your house key yourself.
- An **exchange** is like giving your key to someone else for safekeeping.

## Why This Matters
If you control your keys, you control your money.
If someone else controls them, you must trust them.

## Key Takeaway
Web3 gives freedom, but also responsibility.
