# How Large Language Models "Think"

## Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) do not think or understand language like humans.
They generate responses by predicting the most likely next token based on patterns learned from data.

## Pattern Learning, Not Reasoning
LLMs learn statistical relationships between words, phrases, and concepts during training.

## Tokens and Probability
At each step, the model selects the next token based on probability distributions.

## Why LLMs Sound Intelligent
Their training data contains vast examples of human reasoning, which allows them to mimic logical patterns.

## Limitations
LLMs can produce incorrect or misleading information because they do not possess true understanding.

## Summary
LLMs simulate intelligence through pattern prediction, not conscious thought.
