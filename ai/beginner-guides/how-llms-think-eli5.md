# How AI Thinks (Explained Simply)

## Imagine This
Think of AI like a very advanced autocomplete on your phone.
It doesn’t know the meaning of words — it guesses what comes next.

## What AI Is Really Doing
AI looks at many examples of text and learns which words usually come after others.

## Why It Sounds Smart
It has seen millions of conversations, so it copies patterns that sound intelligent.

## What AI Cannot Do
AI does not understand, feel, or think like a human.
It can still make confident mistakes.

## Key Takeaway
AI predicts words, it doesn’t truly think.
